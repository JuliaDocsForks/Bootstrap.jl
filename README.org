* Motivation

Bootstrapping is a widely applicable technique for statistical estimation,
especially in the absence of closed-form solutions.

* Functionality

- Bootstrapping statistics with different sampling methods:
  + Random resampling with replacement (the =boot_basic= bootstrap)
  + Random weighted resampling with replacement (the =boot_weight= bootstrap)
  + Balanced random resampling, reducing the bias (the =boot_balanced= bootstrap)
  + Exact resampling, iterating through all unique samples (the =boot_exact=,
    deterministic bootstrap, suited only for small samples sizes)

- Confidence intervals:
  + Basic (the =ci_basic= method)
  + Percentile (the =ci_perc= method)
  + Normal distribution (the =ci_normal= method)
  + Bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) (the =ci_bca= method)


* Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  using Bootstrap

  ## sample data, taken from a standard normal distribution
  r = randn(50);

  ## bootstrap the 'mean'
  ## not the most interesting case, but let's start light and simple

  ## basic bootstrap
  bs1 = boot_basic(r, median, 1000);

  bs1

  ## bias and variance of the bootstrapped estimates
  bias(bs1)
  se(bs1)

  ## balanced bootstrap
  bs2 = boot_balanced(r, median, 1000);

  bias(bs2)
  se(bs2)

  ## 95% confidence intervals
  ## basic CIs
  bci1 = ci_basic(bs1, 0.95);

  ## percentile CIs
  bci2 = ci_perc(bs1, 0.95);

  interval(bci1)
  interval(bci2)

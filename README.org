* Motivation

Bootstrapping is a widely applicable technique for statistical estimation,
especially in the absence of closed-form solutions.

* Functionality

- Bootstrapping statistics with different sampling methods:
  + Random resampling with replacement (the =boot_basic= bootstrap)
  + Random weighted resampling with replacement (the =boot_weight= bootstrap)
  + Balanced random resampling, reducing the bias (the =boot_balanced= bootstrap)
  + Exact resampling, iterating through all unique samples (the =boot_exact=,
    deterministic bootstrap, suited only for small samples sizes)

- Confidence intervals:
  + Basic (the =ci_basic= method)
  + Percentile (the =ci_perc= method)
  + Normal distribution (the =ci_normal= method)
  + Bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) (the =ci_bca= method)


* Examples

This illustrates a bit the basic usage and cornerstone function of the package.
More elaborate examples are covered in the [[file:doc/index.org][documentation]].

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  using Bootstrap
#+END_SRC

Our observations are sampled from a standard normal distribution.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  r = randn(50);
#+END_SRC

Let's bootstrap the standard deviation (=std=) of our data, based on 1000
resamples and with different bootstrapping approaches.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  n_boot = 1000;

  ## basic bootstrap
  bs1 = boot_basic(r, std, n_boot);
  ## balanced bootstrap
  bs2 = boot_balanced(r, std, n_boot);
#+END_SRC

We can explore the properties of the bootstrapped samples, for example estimated
bias and standard error of our statistic.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  bias(bs1)
  se(bs1)
#+END_SRC

Further, we can estimate confidence intervals for our statistic of interest,
based on the bootstrapped samples.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  ## 95% confidence intervals
  cil = 0.95;

  ## basic CI
  bci1 = ci_basic(bs1, cil);

  ## percentile CI
  bci2 = ci_perc(bs1, cil);

  ## BCa CI
  bci3 = ci_bca(bs1, cil);
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  interval(bci1)
#+END_SRC
